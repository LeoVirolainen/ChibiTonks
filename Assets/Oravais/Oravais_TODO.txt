TO DO:

- automated troop dying when fired upon: DONE!
- phase playhead: DONE! (could do with some tweening)
  - Also: name each phase and display name near playhead
- sound effects (mix together variants of different size volleys to be triggered when a lot of troops fire)
- main combat phase
  - track movements and targeted formations
- fine tune troop positions (esp. swedes south of lilltr√§sk)
- put name labels on troops
- info text for each phase: where? side?
